# Game concept:
 Singularity is a 2.5D real time strategy game inspired by [Achikaps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yio.tro.achikaps&hl=en "Achikaps Play Store Link").
 You are an AI that has just landed on a foreign planet with no idea what to expect.
 You are tasked with creating a base of operations and to mine the resources in this new unexplored area and create a new home for yourself.
 
 Singularity is a unique real-time strategy game that gives players the ability to build complex networks in abstracted graphics, while the innovative blueprinting system makes it easy for players to build these growing networks.
 However, as the player lets his creativity run wild, he must not neglect the micromanagement of individual network components, which can easily lose their efficiency without their control.
 At the same time, they will explore a new unknown world in which there are new resources to discover and which will require constant adaptation.
 In combat, players can take full tactical control of their troops to reach their full potential.
 To master the adventure, players are required to balance curiosity, creativity, and acumen, rewarding their efforts with a compelling story.

This game is being created as a part of the practical software course at the University of Freiburg.
Look forward to the launch of this exciting new game!
